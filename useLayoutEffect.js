/**

useLayoutEffect is a hook in React that is similar to the useEffect hook, but it is executed synchronously after the DOM layout is updated. 
This means that it is guaranteed to fire after the browser has painted, making it suitable for tasks that need to read or write layout properties, 
  such as measuring the size of an element or manipulating the position of an element.

Here is an example of how the useLayoutEffect hook can be used in a React function component:

*/

import { useLayoutEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const elementRef = useRef(null);

  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    // measure the size of the element
    const rect = elementRef.current.getBoundingClientRect();
    console.log(`Element size: ${rect.width} x ${rect.height}`);
  });

  return <div ref={elementRef}>Hello World</div>;
}

/**

This component renders a div element and uses the useLayoutEffect hook to measure the size of the element after it has been rendered. 
The useLayoutEffect hook takes a function as an argument, which is executed after the DOM layout is updated.

*/
